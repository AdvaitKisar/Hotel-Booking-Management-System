## Introduction
This project helps to book rooms in a hotel as per our choice and allots the same after checking for availability of the room as per our input. It also helps us to process and manage the billing system and maintains the financial records for the hotel as well.
# Files used
The project mainly has a main python file (*main.py*) which invokes the function python file's (*func.py*) **'Home'** function. The **Home** function in turn prompts the user to select an option from 8 options, which are listed in the file (*home.txt*). As per the user's input for the previous prompt, the program invokes the corresponding function. The menu of the restaurant is stored in the text file (*menu.txt*) and excelsheet (*menu.xlsx*). The room info is stored in the text file (*room_info.txt*). The record of all customers is stored in the excelsheet named *Customer Data of Hotel <hotel_name>.xlsx*.
